# Teaching Item 1

## Getting to the Project 


Open a new note at hackmd.io. From the menu, select "import gist". Then paste in the link https://gist.github.com/sergeballif/774ca9c4a323ca4a95e36ccb60c28dbd to get your own copy of the lesson template with instructions. Edit the code on the left and the output gets displayed on the right. Good luck.
