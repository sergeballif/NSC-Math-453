# Teaching Item 1

## Getting to the Project 


Go to [overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qmfjntpbbsdw) to open the template. Click the link to **clone** the project. Click the link to **Sign Up** so that you can save your progress.

Now you should see a project that contains the instructions. You edit the code on the left and the output gets displayed on the right. Good luck.
