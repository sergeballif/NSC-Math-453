# Guided Practice 12: Investigation 6

## Preview

We continue exploring different number systems in Investigation 6. We are putting the "abstract" into abstract algebra as we try to determine which properties will hold in each system.

## Reading

Read all of Investigation 6, pages __63--74__ in the textbook. Review the main concepts of Investigations 1–5 as needed.

## Learning Objectives 

The following are basic tasks that you should be familiar with when you come to class. The Concept Checks will cover the objectives of __CC.11__. Come prepared to do the following:


+ Identify algebraic properties satisfied by general number systems (including subsets of the real numbers, the complex numbers, square matrices, and set collections).
+ State the definition of the sets $\mathbb{Q}$, $\mathbb{Q}$, $M_{n\times n}(\mathbb{R})$, and the Gaussian Integers.
+ Find the power set of a set $S$ and the symmetric difference of two sets.
+ Know how to carry out "addition" and "multiplication" in $\mathcal{P}_n$.

## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.

1. Complete Activity 6.3 after first replaceing $\mathbb{Q}$ with the set of positive real numbers $\mathbb{R}^+$ that uses the operations $\oplus$ (addition) and $\odot$ (multiplication) as follows: 
  + $a\oplus b=ab$, and
  + $a\odot b=a^{\ln(b)}$.
You will need to make adjustments so that the questions are appropriate. For example a question talking about $0$ in $\mathbb{Q}$ should be rephrased as a question about the additive identity of $\mathbb{R}^+$. (Be sure to review your rules of logarithms if you need to. For example $x^y=e^{\ln(x^y)}=e^{y\ln(x)}$.)
