# Guided Practice 1: Investigation 1

## Preview

We will be following up on our introduction to the properties of the integers by discussing the axioms for ordering and working on proof validation and proof-writing activities that involve both the arithmetic and ordering axioms. We will begin with an Concept Check Quiz (see objectives below). 

## Reading

In the Hodge/Schlicker/Sundstrom text, read all of Investigation 1 (pages 3–9). Note that about half of this was already covered in class on Tuesday, but there are portions of that material that we did not stress, so you should still read the material in the book. You do NOT have to work the “Activities” in the book unless you want to, because we will be working on these in class.

## Learning Objectives 

The following are basic tasks that you should be familiar with when you come to class. We will not re-teach these in class, although after the Concept Check quiz we will have time for questions and answers on them. The Concept Check quiz will be drawn from objectives __CC 1__ and __CC 2__. Be sure that can do the following:

+ Identify the elements of the sets $\mathbb{N}$, $\mathbb{W}$, and $\mathbb{Z}$.
+ Know the Axioms for Integer Arithmetic and be able to recognize them or to carry them out if asked to do so.
+ State the definition of the additive inverse of an integer.
+ State the Ordering Axioms of the Integers.
+ State the Zero Product Property (Theorem 1.10).
+ State the Multiplicative Cancellation Law (Theorem 1.11).

## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.

1. The Axioms for Integer Arithmetic include rules for addition and multiplication, but nothing for subtraction or division. Why is that?
2. One of the items of “common knowledge” is that a negative number times another negative number equals a positive number. However, this statement does not appear among the four Ordering Axioms for the Integers, so if it’s true then it must be something we have to prove using the axioms. Looking at the Ordering Axioms, which one do you think would be the most useful for proving this fact, and why?
3. Do you have any concerns or questions about the course, now that you’ve had a chance to get into and read the syllabus? (If you haven’t read the syllabus yet, stop what you’re doing and go do that right now.)
