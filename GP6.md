# Guided Practice 6: A recap

## Preview

The next class period will be a review period. You are encouraged to come with questions that will help you prepare for the upcoming assessment. 

## Reading

In your textbook, review all of Investigations 1 through 3.  

## Learning Objectives 

The following are basic tasks that you should be familiar with when you come to class. The Concept Check quiz will be drawn from objectives __CC.5__ and __CC.6__ that were covered in Investigation 3. Come prepared to do the following:

+ Define the concept of a common divisor of two integers.
+ Define the concept of the greatest common divisor of two integers.
+ Given two integers (including 0 and negative integers) compute their GCD.
+ Define the concept of a linear combination of two integers.
+ State the result of Theorem 3.9 (Bezout’s Identity).
+ State the result of Theorem 3.4.
+ Define what it means for two integers to be relatively prime.
+ Given two integers, determine whether they are relatively prime.
+ Define what it means for a number to be a linear combination of two integers.
+ Determine whether a given integer can be written as a linear combination of two given integers.


## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.

1. Go to https://student.desmos.com/?prepopulateCode=8gdj22 and complete the activity. Some of the answers will be clear, but others will be more speculative. Come prepared to lead a discussion on the activity.
