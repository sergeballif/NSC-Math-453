# Guided Practice 24: Investigation 11 Polynomial Rings

## Preview

We continue on with our study of polynomial rings. We will take specific care to differentiate between polynomials and polynomial functions. 

## Reading

In your textbook, review all of Investigation 11.

## Learning Objectives 

The quiz will be on CC.17. After your reading and practice you should come prepared to do the following:

+ State the definition of a __polynomial in $x$__ over a ring $R$.
+ Define the set $R[x]$ where $R$ is a ring.
+ Given a polynomial over a ring $R$, identify: the __indeterminate__, the __terms__ of the polynomial, the __coefficients__ of the polynomial, the __constant term__ of the polynomial,  the __leading coefficient__ of the polynomial, and the __degree__ of the polynomial
+ State the definition of a __monic polynomial__ over a ring $R$.
+ Given a ring $R$, state the __zero polynomial__ over R and give an example of a __constant polynomial__ over R.
+ State what it means for two polynomials to be equal.
+ Write a polynomial with indeterminate $x$ in descending powers of $x$ and ascending powers of $x$.
+ Add and multiply two polynomials over a ring $R$.
+ State and apply the results of Theorems 11.6 and 11.7 as well as Corollary 11.11.
+ Given a polynomial $p(x)$ over a ring $R$, state the definition of the __polynomial function induced by $p(x)$__.

## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.

1. Let $S$ be the subset of $\mathbb{R}[x]$ consisting of polynomials whose terms all have even degree. Is $S$ a subring of $\mathbb{R}[x]$?
2. Let $S=\{f(x)\in\mathbb{R}[x]\mid f(2)=0\}$. Is $S$ a subring of $\mathbb{R}[x]$?
3. Identify a nontrivial, proper subring of $\mathbb{Z}_3[x]$ that is not equal to $\mathbb{Z}_3$.
