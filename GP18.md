# Guided Practice 18: Investigation 9 Subrings, Extensions, and Direct Sums

## Preview

Investigation 9 deals with three important concepts about rings:

+ __Subrings__ — which are small rings that live inside larger ones
+ __Ring extensions__ — which result when you take an existing ring and expand it by adding a new element and all the extra elements needed to retain closure
+ __Direct sums__  — which is a way of taking two rings and “attaching” them to each other to form a third ring.

In this Investigation we will be studying these concepts and especially focusing on __subfields__ and __field extensions__. Field extensions are important for doing basic algebraic calculations such as solving polynomial equations like $x^2+1=0$, and in this Investigation we’ll get our first brush with the algebra of polynomials, which is of paramount importance later.

## Reading

In your textbook, review all of Investigation 9.

## Learning Objectives 

The Concept Check will be __CC.14__. After your reading and practice you should come prepared to do the following:

+ Calculate an integer multiple of a ring element and an integer exponent of a ring element. (Including non-positive integers.)
+ Define the meaning of the expressions $n\cdot x$ and $x^n$ where $x$ is an element of any ring and $n$ is an integer.
+ State the results of Theorems 8.5, 8.7, 8.8, and 8.12.
+ Define the concept of the __characteristic__ of a ring.
+ Given a ring, determine its characteristic.
+ Define the following terms: __subring__, __extension of a ring__, __subfield__, __field extension__, __field extension generated by a set $S$__, __simple extension of a field__, __Cartesian product of sets__, __direct sum of rings__.
+ State Theorems 9.3 and 9.4 (The Subring Test).
+ Use the Subring Test (Theorem 9.4) to determine if a subset of a ring is a subring.
+ Given two finite sets $S$ and $T$ write out the elements in their Cartesian product.
+ Given two rings $R$ and $S$, perform operations in their direct sum $R\oplus S$.

## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.
