# Guided Practice 15: Investigation 7 An Introduction to Rings

## Preview

We continue on with our investigations of rings. It is important for us to accumulate examples (and non-examples) of rings and for us to be able to recognize various flavors of rings such as commutative rings, integral domains, and fields. Now that we have a firm grasp on some of the algebraic properties that are satisfied by all rings we devote most of our class period to proving these results.

## Reading

In your textbook, review all of Investigation 7.

## Learning Objectives 

The Concept Checks will be __CC.12__ and __CC.13__. Come prepared to do the following:

+ State the definition of a ring, including all seven of the ring axioms.
+ State the results of the following Theorems: 7.3, 7.5, 7.17, 7.19, 7.20, and 7.21.
+ Define what it means for a ring to be commutative, and give examples of both a commutative ring and a noncommutative ring.
+ Define the identity of a ring, and give examples of both a ring with identity and a ring without identity.
+ Define the multiplicative inverse of a ring (with identity).
+ Define a unit in a ring with identity.
+ Define a zero divisor in a ring.
+ Define the concepts of an integral domain and a field.
+ Given a specific ring with identity and an element in that ring, determine whether that element is a unit, and determine whether the element is a zero divisor.
+ Given a ring, determine whether it is an integral domain and/or a field.

## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.

1. Let $R$ be a ring. Suppose that, due to a printer error, the addition and multiplication tables for $R$ were printed with several entries missing, as show below:
  | $+$ 	| $a$ 	| $b$ 	| $c$ 	|
  | $a$ 	| $a$ 	| $b$ 	| $c$ 	|
  | $b$ 	|     	| $c$ 	|     	|
  | $c$ 	|     	|     	|     	|

  | $\times$ 	| $a$ 	| $b$ 	| $c$ 	|
  |----------	|-----	|-----	|-----	|
  | $a$      	|     	|     	|     	|
  | $b$      	|     	| $a$ 	|     	|
  | $c$      	|     	|     	|     	|

Complete the tables using your knowledge of the rings axioms (and any relevant theorems). Be sure to include enough justification so that a reader can understand your work.

2. Complete the same activity, but with the multiplication table below.

  | $\times$ 	| $a$ 	| $b$ 	| $c$ 	|
  |----------	|-----	|-----	|-----	|
  | $a$      	|     	|     	|     	|
  | $b$      	|     	|      	|     	|
  | $c$      	|     	|     	|  $b$	|
