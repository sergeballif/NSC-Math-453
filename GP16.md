# Guided Practice 16: Investigation 8 An Introduction to Rings

## Preview

Now that we have defined the concept of a ring and explored some of the basic arithmetic-like properties that rings have, in this investigation we will take up a logical extension of the idea of arithmetic: __How to define and handle repeated addition and repeated multiplication (exponentiation)__. We will be developing rules for repeated addition and for exponentiation that reflect the rules we use everyday for familiar number systems, but now they will apply to all rings. Along the way, we will see that some rings have strange properties when considering repeated multiplication and exponentiation, and this will lead us to the important concept of the __characteristic__ of a ring, which is the smallest number of times we can add elements of a ring to themselves to get the zero element in the ring.
## Reading

In your textbook, review all of Investigation 8.

## Learning Objectives 

The Concept Checks will be __CC.12__ and __CC.13__. Come prepared to do the following:

+ State the definition of a ring, including all seven of the ring axioms.
+ State the results of the following Theorems: 7.3, 7.5, 7.17, 7.19, 7.20, and 7.21.
+ Define what it means for a ring to be commutative, and give examples of both a commutative ring and a noncommutative ring.
+ Define the identity of a ring, and give examples of both a ring with identity and a ring without identity.
+ Define the multiplicative inverse of a ring (with identity).
+ Define a unit in a ring with identity.
+ Define a zero divisor in a ring.
+ Define the concepts of an integral domain and a field.
+ Given a specific ring with identity and an element in that ring, determine whether that element is a unit, and determine whether the element is a zero divisor.
+ Given a ring, determine whether it is an integral domain and/or a field.
+ Calculate an integer multiple of a ring element and an integer exponent of a ring element. (Including non-positive integers.)
+ Define the meaning of the expressions $n\cdot x$ and $x^n$ where $x$ is an element of any ring and $n$ is an integer.
+ State the results of Theorems 8.5, 8.7, 8.8, and 8.12.
+ Define the concept of the __characteristic__ of a ring.
+ Given a ring, determine its characteristic.

## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.
