# Guided Practice 20: Review

## Preview

We will be going over review problems for the test. Please go over the CORE problems from the homework.

## Reading

In your textbook, review all of Investigations 7, 8, and 9.

## Learning Objectives 

The Concept Check will be __CC.15__. After your reading and practice you should come prepared to do the following:

+ Define the following terms: __subring__, __extension of a ring__, __subfield__, __field extension__, __field extension generated by a set $S$__, __simple extension of a field__, __Cartesian product of sets__, __direct sum of rings__.
+ State Theorems 9.3 and 9.4 (The Subring Test).
+ Use the Subring Test (Theorem 9.4) to determine if a subset of a ring is a subring.
+ Given two finite sets $S$ and $T$ write out the elements in their Cartesian product.
+ Given two rings $R$ and $S$, perform operations in their direct sum $R\oplus S$.

## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.

1. Let $R$ be a ring, and let $r\in R$. Prove that $S=\\{x\in R\mid rx=0\\}$ is a subring of $R$.
2. Let $R$ be a ring with identity, and let $S$ be the set of all units of $R$. Is $S$ always, sometimes, or never a subring of $R$? Give a proof or a pair of examples (whichever is appropriate) to justify your answer.
3. Let $R$ and $S$ be integral domains. Is $R\oplus S$ always, sometimes, or never an integral domain? Give a proof or a pair of examples (whichever is appropriate) to justify your answer.
