# Guided Practice 23: Investigation 11 Polynomial Rings

## Preview

In Investigation 11 we will be studying an algebraic concept that we are all familiar with: the polynomial. We will be looking at polynomials in abstraction, as ring elements that we add and multiply together. And we will be “hacking” polynomials by changing the coefficients on them to come not from the real numbers (as we usually take them in high school algebra) but from any ring whatsoever. We’ll be asking — what results about polynomials, that might be familiar to us from high school math, still remain true when we change the coefficients? By answering those questions, we should come to a better understanding about why our classical high school algebra facts are what they are.

## Reading

In your textbook, review all of Investigation 11.

## Learning Objectives 

The quiz will be on CC.16, though you should be be preparing for CC.17. After your reading and practice you should come prepared to do the following:

+ (Review if needed) State the definitions of the following terms: __function__; __surjective function__; __injective function__; __bijective function__.
+ (Review if needed) Determine whether a given function is or is not injective, surjective, or bijective.
+ State what it means for a function between two rings to __preserve addition__ or __preserve multiplication__.
+ State the formal definition of an __isomorphism__ of two rings (Definition 10.5).
+ Identify from operation tables when two rings are, or are not, isomorphic. (For example see  Preview Activity 10.1.)
+ Explain the steps involved in proving that a function from one ring to another is an isomorphism.
+ State what it means for a function to be __well-defined__.
+ State what it means for a ring property to be __invariant__.
+ State the properties on the list of ring invariants.
+ State the definition of a __polynomial in $x$__ over a ring $R$.
+ Define the set $R[x]$ where $R$ is a ring.
+ Given a polynomial over a ring $R$, identify: the __indeterminate__, the __terms__ of the polynomial, the __coefficients__ of the polynomial, the __constant term__ of the polynomial,  the __leading coefficient__ of the polynomial, and the __degree__ of the polynomial
+ State the definition of a __monic polynomial__ over a ring $R$.
+ Given a ring $R$, state the __zero polynomial__ over R and give an example of a __constant polynomial__ over R.
+ State what it means for two polynomials to be equal.
+ Write a polynomial with indeterminate $x$ in descending powers of $x$ and ascending powers of $x$.
+ Add and multiply two polynomials over a ring $R$.
+ State and apply the results of Theorems 11.6 and 11.7 as well as Corollary 11.11.
+ Given a polynomial $p(x)$ over a ring $R$, state the definition of the __polynomial function induced by $p(x)$__.

## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.

1.  Consider the polynomial $p(t)=2t^2+3t+2$. State the following: The name of the indeterminate; the terms of the polynomial; the constant term of the polynomial; the degree of the polynomial; the coefficients of the polynomial; and the leading coefficient of the polynomial. Finally, state the ring $R$ to which the coefficients belong (note that there could be more than one answer).
2. Work through all of Preview Activity 11.1.
