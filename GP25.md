# Guided Practice 23: Investigations 12 and 13 Divisibility in Polynomial Rings

## Preview

In our final investigations of this course, we will work more with polynomials to understand an important algebraic operation: division of polynomials. You may remember that polynomials, much like integers, can be divided using a Division Algorithm-like long division process. In Investigation 12 we will develop this algorithm for a general polynomial ring $R[x]$ with a dual focus on understanding how the algorithm works when $R$ is something familiar ($R=\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{Q}$) and where it breaks down if $R$ is something else ($R=\mathbb{Z} or $\mathbb{Z}_n$).
## Reading

In your textbook, read all of Investigation 12. Read up through Theorem 13.5 in Investigation 13.

## Learning Objectives 

The quiz will be on CC.17, though you should be be preparing for CC.18, CC.19, CC.20, and CC.21. After your reading and practice you should come prepared to do the following:

+ State the definition of a __polynomial in $x$__ over a ring $R$.
+ Define the set $R[x]$ where $R$ is a ring.
+ Given a polynomial over a ring $R$, identify: the __indeterminate__, the __terms__ of the polynomial, the __coefficients__ of the polynomial, the __constant term__ of the polynomial,  the __leading coefficient__ of the polynomial, and the __degree__ of the polynomial
+ State the definition of a __monic polynomial__ over a ring $R$.
+ Given a ring $R$, state the __zero polynomial__ over R and give an example of a __constant polynomial__ over R.
+ State what it means for two polynomials to be equal.
+ Write a polynomial with indeterminate $x$ in descending powers of $x$ and ascending powers of $x$.
+ Add and multiply two polynomials over a ring $R$.
+ State and apply the results of Theorems 11.6 and 11.7 as well as Corollary 11.11.
+ Given a polynomial $p(x)$ over a ring $R$, state the definition of the __polynomial function induced by $p(x)$__.
+ (Review) State the definitions or statements of the following: what it means for one integer to divide another; the Division Algorithm; the greatest common divisor of two integers; prime number; the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.
+ State the definition of what it means for one polynomial to __divide__ another.
+ State the results of the following: Theorem 12.3, Theorem 12.10.
+ State the Division Algorithm for polynomials.
+ Use the Division Algorithm for polynomials to find the quotient and remainder when one polynomial is divided by another.
+ State the definition of the __greatest common divisor__ of two polynomials.
+ State what it means for two polynomials to be __relatively prime__.
+ Describe the steps of the Euclidean Algorithm for polynomials and use it to calculate the GCD of two polynomials.
+ State the definition of a __root__ of a polynomial.
+ State the Factor Theorem and use it to factor a polynomial.
+ State the Remainder Theorem and apply it to find the remainder when a polynomial is divided by a monic polynomial of degree 1. 

## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.
