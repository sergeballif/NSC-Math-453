# Guided Practice 14: Investigation 7 An Introduction to Rings

## Preview

This investigation introduces the main character in Math 453: the ring. A __ring__ is an abstract number system – that is, it is a nonempty set with two binary operations that satisfy a list of properties. Most of the familiar number systems we have studied up to this point are instances of rings. The point of introducing this level of abstraction is that, if we can prove a mathematical result that holds for a generic ring, then that result automatically holds for all specific instances. That is, with abstraction we are able to prove algebraic results that hold not only in special cases but in many different cases all at the same time. This is serious power!

We will introduce the definition of a ring and then examine some properties that all rings share. We will distinguish between commutative and non-commutative rings, rings with multiplicative identity and those without, and show that if an element in a ring has a multiplicative inverse then that inverse is unique. We will then look at zero divisors in rings and several mathematical results about equation-solving that follow from facts about zero divisors. Finally, we will look briefly at two special kinds of rings: __integral domains__ (commutative rings with identity that have no zero divisors) and __fields__ (commutative rings with identity such that every nonzero element is a unit).

## Reading

In your textbook, read all of Investigation 7.

## Learning Objectives 

There will be no Concept Check. However it is important that you complete a careful reading of the entire investigation. Come prepared to do the following:

+ State the definition of a ring, including all seven of the ring axioms.
+ State the results of the following Theorems: 7.3, 7.5, 7.17, 7.19, 7.20, and 7.21.
+ Define what it means for a ring to be commutative, and give examples of both a commutative ring and a noncommutative ring.
+ Define the identity of a ring, and give examples of both a ring with identity and a ring without identity.
+ Define the multiplicative inverse of a ring (with identity).
+ Define a unit in a ring with identity.
+ Define a zero divisor in a ring.
+ Define the concepts of an integral domain and a field.
+ Given a specific ring with identity and an element in that ring, determine whether that element is a unit, and determine whether the element is a zero divisor.
+ Given a ring, determine whether it is an integral domain and/or a field.

## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.

1. Complete Preview Activity 7.1. 
2. Compare your list from Preview Activity 7.1 with the ring axioms of Defintion 7.2. Are the two lists identical?
