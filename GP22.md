# Guided Practice 22: Investigation 10 Isomorphisms and Invariants

## Preview

We continue to investigate isomorphisms of rings. 

## Reading

In your textbook, review all of Investigation 10.

## Learning Objectives 

The quiz will be Concept Check 16. After your reading and practice you should come prepared to do the following:

+ (Review if needed) State the definitions of the following terms: __function__; __surjective function__; __injective function__; __bijective function__.
+ (Review if needed) Determine whether a given function is or is not injective, surjective, or bijective.
+ State what it means for a function between two rings to __preserve addition__ or __preserve multiplication__.
+ State the formal definition of an __isomorphism__ of two rings (Definition 10.5).
+ Identify from operation tables when two rings are, or are not, isomorphic. (For example see  Preview Activity 10.1.)
+ Explain the steps involved in proving that a function from one ring to another is an isomorphism.
+ State what it means for a function to be __well-defined__.
+ State what it means for a ring property to be __invariant__.
+ State the properties on the list of ring invariants.

## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.
