# Guided Practice 8: Investigation 4

## Preview

Now that we have reviewed the idea of mathematical induction and discussed what it means for a number to be prime were are ready to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic which states that every natural number has a unique prime factorization. The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic allows us to take any natural number and write it in terms of a product of basic building blocks in a unique way, and the primes are those building blocks. 

## Reading

In your textbook, review pages __33–40__. 

## Learning Objectives 

The following are basic tasks that you should be familiar with when you come to class. The Concept Checks will cover the objectives of __CC.7__ and __CC.8__. Come prepared to do the following:

+ State the definition of __prime number__ and __composite number__.
+ List at least 10 prime numbers, at least one of which is greater than three digits in length.
+ State the __Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic__.
+ Given a natural number, write out its prime factorization.
+ Outline the overall strategy and steps used in a proof by mathematical induction.
+ Given an assertion that is to be proven by mathematical induction, clearly state the base case, the hypothesis of the induction step, and the conclusion of the inductive step.
+ State __Euclid’s Lemma__ (both the “weak” form on page 36 and the “strong” form on page 37).

## Induction Videos

Once again I want to stress the importance of knowing the principle of mathematical induction. I wanted to ask you to search online for it, but I tried that and I got a lot of birthing videos, so I'll just give you another video that you can watch to review.

## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.

1. Complete Preview Activity 4.3.
2. Show that $$1\cdot 2+3\cdot 4+5\cdot6+\cdots (2n-1)(2n)=\frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{3}$$ for each natural number $n$.
