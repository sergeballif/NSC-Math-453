# Guided Practice 17: Investigation 8 Multiplication and Exponents

## Preview

We will continue exploring the idea of the characteristic of a ring. Along the way we will supply the proofs of several results from the previous lecture. Along the way we will state and see examples of the power Binomial Theorem.

## Reading

In your textbook, review all of Investigation 8.

## Learning Objectives 

The Concept Check will be __CC.14__. Come prepared to do the following:

+ Calculate an integer multiple of a ring element and an integer exponent of a ring element. (Including non-positive integers.)
+ Define the meaning of the expressions $n\cdot x$ and $x^n$ where $x$ is an element of any ring and $n$ is an integer.
+ State the results of Theorems 8.5, 8.7, 8.8, and 8.12.
+ Define the concept of the __characteristic__ of a ring.
+ Given a ring, determine its characteristic.

## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.
