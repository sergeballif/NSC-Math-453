# Guided Practice 21: Investigation 10 Isomorphisms and Invariants

## Preview

Investigation 10 focuses on one main idea: the notion of an isomorphism of rings. When we say two rings are “isomorphic” it means that they are “essentially the same” — despite superficial differences, the essential ways in which the operations of the two rings work are all the same. The goal of this investigation is to make “essential sameness” precise. We will do so using the tool of __functions__, specifically __bijective functions__ that __preserve the operations__ of the rings. Such a function is called an __isomorphism__. As a consequence, we will examine several __invariants__ of rings — properties of rings that are preserved by isomorphisms.

## Reading

In your textbook, review all of Investigation 10.

In addition, here are links to some screencasts that cover basic information and techniques about functions. We will not be covering basic material about functions in class, so if you feel you need to review, watch these videos and take notes and ask questions.

## Learning Objectives 

There will be no concept check. However you may need to review some basic terminology about functions. After your reading and practice you should come prepared to do the following:

+ (Review if needed) State the definitions of the following terms: __function__; __surjective function__; __injective function__; __bijective function__.
+ (Review if needed) Determine whether a given function is or is not injective, surjective, or bijective.
+ State what it means for a function between two rings to __preserve addition__ or __preserve multiplication__.
+ State the formal definition of an __isomorphism__ of two rings (Definition 10.5).
+ Identify from operation tables when two rings are, or are not, isomorphic. (For example see  Preview Activity 10.1.)
+ Explain the steps involved in proving that a function from one ring to another is an isomorphism.
+ State what it means for a function to be __well-defined__.
+ State what it means for a ring property to be __invariant__.
+ State the properties on the list of ring invariants.

## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.

1. Work through all of Preview Activity 10.1, which asks you to examine four different rings and state which ones are “essentially the same”. Give brief but good reasons for your responses.
