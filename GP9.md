# Guided Practice 9: Investigation 5

## Preview

Now we encounter the idea of equivalence relations and the number system $\mathbb{Z}_n$. This is our first investigation that gets us into the territory of abstraction that makes modern algebra what it is. We will be building basic tools to explore what aspects of algebra extend to other algebraic “universes” and so this is a big, important section for us.

We will first look at the concept of congruence classes of integers modulo $n$, which is a way of grouping together integers that are congruent to each other and treating the entire group as one object. We then look at a generalization of this idea in the notion equivalence relations and equivalence classes. Armed with these ideas we define a new “number system” $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and define two binary operations on this system, creating a new, finite, self-contained algebra world. Within this system we will begin to ask questions about how algebra is done, namely about the existence of zero divisors, units, and multiplicative inverses.

## Reading

In your textbook, review pages __45--58__. 

## Learning Objectives 

The following are basic tasks that you should be familiar with when you come to class. The Concept Checks will cover the objectives of __CC.7__ and __CC.8__. Come prepared to do the following:

+ State the definition of __prime number__ and __composite number__.
+ List at least 10 prime numbers, at least one of which is greater than three digits in length.
+ State the __Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic__.
+ Given a natural number, write out its prime factorization.
+ Outline the overall strategy and steps used in a proof by mathematical induction.
+ Given an assertion that is to be proven by mathematical induction, clearly state the base case, the hypothesis of the induction step, and the conclusion of the inductive step.
+ State __Euclid’s Lemma__ (both the “weak” form on page 36 and the “strong” form on page 37).
+ State the definition of the __congruence class of an integer $a$ modulo $n$__, and given values of $a$ and $n$ list several elements of the congruence class of  $a$ modulo $n$.
+ Define the term __binary relation__.
+ State the definition of an __equivalence relation__ on a nonempty set $S$. In particular, state the three properties a binary relation on $S$ must satisfy in order to be an equivalence relation.
+ State the definition of the __equivalence class__ of an element $a$ of a set $S$ with respect to an equivalence relation $\sim$.
+ State the three main results of Theorem 5.6.
+ Define the integers modulo $n$ (that is, $\mathbb{Z}_n$) for an integer $n\ge 2$.
+ Explain how to “add” and “multiply” two objects in $\mathbb{Z}_n$. Note that the objects in $\mathbb{Z}_n$ are not numbers but sets, so this is not a no-brainer.
+ Define the term __Cartesian product__ $S\times S$ of a set $S$ with itself; and given a set $S$, list several elements of $S\times S$.
+ Define the term binary operation on a set $S$.
+ Define what it means for a binary operation on a set $S$ to be __well-defined__.
+ Define the terms __zero divisor__, __unit__, and __multiplicative inverse__ of elements of $\mathbb{Z}_n$.
+ For a specific, small value of $n$, determine which elements of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ are units and which are zero divisors, and if an element is a unit then find its multiplicative inverse.

## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.

1. Complete Preview Activity 5.1.
2. Explain why $\left[5\right]\_{12}$ is a unit in $\mathbb{Z}\_{12}$. Explain why $\left[4\right]\_{12}$ is a zero divisor in $\mathbb{Z}\_{12}$.
