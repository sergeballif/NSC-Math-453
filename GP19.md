# Guided Practice 18: Investigation 9 Subrings, Extensions, and Direct Sums

## Preview

We will continue exploring subrings, field extensions, and direct products as we prove some of the results that we only stated last time. Be sure to collect examples of rings and to know the various properties of each ring in your collection. Also be able to carry out calculations in each ring.

## Reading

In your textbook, review all of Investigation 9.

## Learning Objectives 

The Concept Check will be __CC.15__. After your reading and practice you should come prepared to do the following:

+ Define the following terms: __subring__, __extension of a ring__, __subfield__, __field extension__, __field extension generated by a set $S$__, __simple extension of a field__, __Cartesian product of sets__, __direct sum of rings__.
+ State Theorems 9.3 and 9.4 (The Subring Test).
+ Use the Subring Test (Theorem 9.4) to determine if a subset of a ring is a subring.
+ Given two finite sets $S$ and $T$ write out the elements in their Cartesian product.
+ Given two rings $R$ and $S$, perform operations in their direct sum $R\oplus S$.

## Reading questions

During your reading or afterwards, answer the following questions. These will be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 on the basis of completeness and effort only. You should give a good-faith effort to answer each exercise and be right in your answer, but if you make a mathematical or conceptual mistake it will not count against you. However, if you leave an item blank, put “I don’t know”, or similarly do not put forth an effort to answer each question, you will lose credit. Be sure to come to class prepared to share your answers and to lead a discussion on these problems.

1. Use the result of Theorem 9.4 (The Subring Test) to prove that the set $\{[0],[2],[4]\}$ is a subring of $\mathbb{Z}_6$. Doing so requires that you verify that three properties hold (specified in the Theorem statement). Note that the second and third ones (closure under multiplication and subtraction) can be verified with tables.
2. Give an example of a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{Z}_6$ that is not a subring of $\mathbb{Z}_6$.
3. Consider the polynomial equation $x^2+1=0$. Note that this equation has no real number solutions — the only solutions are $x=i$ and $x=-i$ in the complex numbers. Let’s say we wanted to create a field (not just a ring) that contains all the real numbers and the complex numbers $i$ and $-i$. Would the following set be a field?
\[S=R\cup\{i,-i\}\]
Why, or why not? (Optional question for further understanding: What would be the smallest field that contains all the real numbers and the complex numbers $x=i$ and $x=-i$?)
4. List all the elements in the direct sum $\mathbb{Z}_3\oplus\mathbb{Z}_2$. (There are six of these.) Then calculate $(2,1)+(2,0)$ and $(2,1)\cdot(2,0)$ in the direct sum.
5. Complete Preview Activity 9.8.
